So, you were browsing on Github and came across this bot? Horny dude.... 

I just spent 30 minutes of my life, on this sunny Sunday of 21-02-2021 (I'm Italian so yes, the date format is dd-mm-yyyy), creating a Telegram Bot that sends random porn gifs to a chat under request. You can use it in both private chats and groups. 

Why did I create this bot? Because I was bored and wanted to do something funny with friends.

This bot doesn't collect data, it does just the minimum necessary to avoid overloading my personal server. You ask **pls porn** and it return a random gif porn. 

Don't judge me for the bot and I won't judge you for searching for gif porn on the web. Bonk.
